# 3d-tic-tac-toe

This is a 3d-enhanced remake of the tic-tac-toe game from the [Tutorial: Intro To React](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html).

[CSS Preprocessor SASS](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc).
